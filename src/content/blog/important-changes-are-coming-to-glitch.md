Today we're announcing some important changes to the [Glitch platform](https://glitch.com) that will shape how we build and collaborate together in the coming months. As the web development landscape continues to evolve, we believe these updates will position Glitch to better serve our community of creators, learners, and professional developers.

> "The future of web development is collaborative, creative, and accessible to everyone. We're building the platform that makes this vision a reality."

## What's Changing

Over the past few years, we've watched how you use Glitch—from quick prototypes to full-scale applications, from classroom learning to production deployments. Your feedback has been invaluable, and these changes reflect what we've heard from you.

### Three Key Areas of Focus

We're focusing on three key areas that matter most to our community:

1. **Improved Performance** — Faster container startup times and more reliable deployments
2. **Enhanced Collaboration** — Real-time editing and better workspace sharing
3. **Robust Infrastructure** — Scalable resources that grow with your ambitions

### New Project Dashboard

The first set of changes you'll notice is a completely redesigned project dashboard. This makes it easier to organize your work and collaborate with others. We've also invested heavily in our container infrastructure to ensure your apps start faster and run more reliably.

For educators and teams, we're introducing new workspace management features that simplify how you onboard new members and manage permissions. Learn more in our [workspace management guide](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/workspace-docs).

#### Container Infrastructure Upgrades

Our engineering team has been hard at work rebuilding our container infrastructure from the ground up. Here's what you can expect:

- **50% faster** cold starts for Node.js applications
- **Automatic scaling** based on traffic patterns
- **Enhanced logging** with real-time log streaming

### Resources for Developers

We've prepared several resources to help you get the most out of these changes:

- [Migration Guide](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/migration) — Step-by-step instructions for transitioning existing projects
- [API Documentation](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/api-docs) — Updated endpoints and new features
- [Community Forum](https://support.glitch.com) — Join the discussion and share your feedback

## Looking Ahead

We know change can be challenging, especially when you're in the middle of a project. That's why we're rolling these updates out gradually over the next few months, with plenty of notice before each phase.

### Timeline

| Phase | Date | Changes |
|-------|------|---------|
| Phase 1 | February 2025 | New dashboard rollout |
| Phase 2 | March 2025 | Container upgrades |
| Phase 3 | April 2025 | Workspace management tools |

We'll be here to support you through the transition, with updated documentation, video tutorials, and our [community forums](https://support.glitch.com) where you can ask questions and share feedback.

## Thank You

Thank you for being part of the Glitch community. Your creativity and passion for building on the open web inspire us every day, and we can't wait to see what you'll create with these new capabilities.
