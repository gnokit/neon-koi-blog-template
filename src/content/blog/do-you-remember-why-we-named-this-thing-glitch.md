People often ask us about the name. Why "Glitch"? In a world of polished, corporate-sounding platforms, why choose a word that literally means a malfunction or error? The answer goes to the heart of what we believe about creativity, technology, and the joy of making things on the web.

## Embracing the Imperfect

The truth is, we fell in love with the word "glitch" because it celebrates the unexpected. In digital art and music, a glitch is something beautiful—a happy accident that reveals the inner workings of a system, a moment where the machine shows its humanity. We wanted a platform that embraced those moments, where broken code isn't a failure but a step on the path to something interesting.

Early in our brainstorming, someone mentioned how video game speedrunners use glitches to achieve the impossible—breaking through walls, skipping entire levels, finding paths the designers never intended. That resonated with us. We wanted to build a platform that encouraged that same spirit of creative exploration, where the "wrong" way to do something might lead to the most interesting results.

## A Name That Stuck

There were other names on the whiteboard that day—safe names, descriptive names, names that told you exactly what the product did. But "Glitch" had personality. It was memorable. It made people curious. And most importantly, it gave us permission to be playful, to not take ourselves too seriously, to build something that felt like it belonged to humans, not corporations.

Years later, that decision still defines us. Every time someone new discovers Glitch and asks about the name, we get to tell this story. We get to share our belief that the web should be a place of happy accidents, where anyone can stumble upon something wonderful by just trying things out. So yes, we're named after a bug—but it's the best kind of bug, the kind that makes you see things differently.
