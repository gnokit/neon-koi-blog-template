Happy New Year, Glitch community! As we settle into 2025, we wanted to share a grab-bag of updates, improvements, and random things we've been excited about. No big announcements this time—just a little of this, a little of that.

## Small Improvements, Big Impact

Sometimes the best changes are the ones you barely notice. This month we fixed a long-standing issue where project previews would occasionally show stale data after a quick refresh. We also tweaked our code editor's autocomplete to be a bit more helpful (and a bit less aggressive). And for those of you working on larger projects, we increased the file watcher limits, which should eliminate those annoying "too many files" warnings.

The community has been busy too. @codewanderer released a collection of custom themes for the Glitch editor that have been gaining popularity. @webwitch published a comprehensive guide to optimizing Node.js apps on our platform that's already helped dozens of developers speed up their projects. It's this kind of grassroots knowledge-sharing that makes Glitch special.

## What's Brewing

We're in the early stages of planning some bigger features for the year ahead. Without giving too much away, we're looking at ways to make real-time collaboration even smoother, exploring new database options for data-heavy applications, and investigating how we might support emerging web standards. Nothing is set in stone yet, but we wanted you to know that the wheels are turning.

In the meantime, keep building, keep experimenting, and keep sharing what you create. The best part of Glitch has always been the community, and you're what makes this platform worth working on. Here's to a creative and glitch-filled 2025!
