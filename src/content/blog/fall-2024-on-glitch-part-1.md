Fall has always been a season of new beginnings, and this year on Glitch has been no exception. As the leaves changed color, our community was busy building incredible things. Here's a look back at what happened in the first half of the season.

## Community Highlights

The creativity this fall has been off the charts. We saw an explosion of generative art projects, with creators experimenting with everything from particle systems to neural network visualizations. One standout was a collaborative poetry generator that combined contributions from over fifty community members into a single, ever-evolving digital chapbook.

Our weekly challenges continued to inspire, with the "Retro Web" theme producing some particularly delightful results. Developers reimagined modern web apps with 90s aesthetics—complete with visitor counters, under-construction GIFs, and MIDI background music. It was a beautiful reminder that good ideas are timeless, even if the styling trends come and go.

## Platform Updates

Behind the scenes, we've been hard at work improving the Glitch experience. This month we shipped faster project containers, reducing boot times by an average of 40%. We also expanded our database offerings, making it easier than ever to add persistent storage to your applications without managing infrastructure.

For those teaching with Glitch, we released new classroom management features that simplify the process of reviewing student work and providing feedback. Educators have told us these changes have saved them hours of administrative time each week.

Stay tuned for Part 2, where we'll cover the rest of the season's highlights and look ahead to what's coming this winter.
