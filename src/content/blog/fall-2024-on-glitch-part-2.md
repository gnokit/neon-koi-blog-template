Welcome back for the second half of our Fall 2024 roundup. November brought its own share of surprises, from unexpected viral projects to the quiet, steady work of our community that makes Glitch such a special place to build.

## Viral Moments

Sometimes a project takes on a life of its own, and that's exactly what happened with the "Nostalgia Generator" created by @pixeldreamer. What started as a simple tool for creating retro Windows 95-style error messages became an internet sensation, generating millions of shares across social media. The creator handled the sudden attention with grace, using the opportunity to highlight other Glitch projects and even adding a "discover more" button that drove thousands of new visitors to our community.

We also saw a wave of collaborative projects as developers prepared for the holiday season. A group of community members organized a "12 Days of Code" event, releasing a new open-source tool or component each day leading up to Thanksgiving. The collection included everything from accessibility helpers to fun CSS animations, all freely available for anyone to use.

## Looking Forward

As we wrap up Fall 2024, we're already looking ahead to the new year. The feedback you've shared is shaping our roadmap, with performance improvements and collaboration features topping the list. We're also planning some special events for the holiday season, including our annual "Glitchmas" celebration where we highlight the most creative seasonal projects.

Thank you for making Fall 2024 one to remember. The projects you built, the bugs you reported, and the help you offered each other are what make this community extraordinary. Here's to whatever we build together next.

*Updated on November 18th to include additional community projects that were submitted after the original publication.*
